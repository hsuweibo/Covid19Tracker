### About COVID-19 Tracker

This is a minimalistic tracker made with create-react-app that monitors the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries, both globally and on a by-country basis. The tracker also provides visualization of historical data, indicating any trend if present. 

The displayed data is fetched from the API endpoints provided at [disease.sh](https://disease.sh/docs/). In particular, the tracker uses data sourced from Worldometers and John Hopskin University.
